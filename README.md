# variance_cyclic_timing
A repository to collect work in progress assessing whether timing of sinusoidal intervals is scalar invariant. 

1. To see where the anlysis stands [click here](cyclic_cv_analysis_cleaned.md) but be warned it is preliminary and I am still finalizing stats that have yet to be uploaded. 
2. Also currently the data are hosted on a local mySQL server. I will export those data to .csv and share on the repo in the future.
