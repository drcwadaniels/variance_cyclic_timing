# variance_cyclic_timing
A repository to collect work in progress assessing whether timing of sinusoidal intervals is scalar invariant. 

1. To see where the anlysis stands checkout .ipynb, .md, and .Rmd files
2. Working draft of MS; very WIP!
3. Data are now provided as SQL dump files and csv files. Additionally an .Rmd file  is provided sketching out how to read the SQL dumps to generate the csvs. Please note files > 25 mb cannot be stored on Github, but can be found at [OSF.io](https://osf.io/m6ag5/)
