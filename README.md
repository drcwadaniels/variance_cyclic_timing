# variance_cyclic_timing
A repository to collect work in progress assessing whether timing of sinusoidal intervals is scalar invariant. 

1. To see where the anlysis stands [click here](cyclic_cv_analysis_cleaned.md) but be warned it is preliminary and I am still finalizing stats that have yet to be uploaded.
2. R Analyses.Rmd are now available, currently they have analyses not easily conducted in Python such as quick lmer fitting to assess polynomials supported by data. 
3. Also currently the data are hosted on a local mySQL server. I will export those data to .csv and share on the repo in the future.
