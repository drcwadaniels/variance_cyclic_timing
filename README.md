# variance_cyclic_timing
A repository to collect work in progress assessing whether timing of sinusoidal intervals is scalar invariant. 

1. To see where the anlysis stands [click here](cyclic_cv_analysis_cleaned.md) but be warned it is preliminary and I am still finalizing stats that have yet to be uploaded.
2. R Analyses.Rmd are now available, currently they have analyses not easily conducted in Python such as quick lmer fitting to assess polynomials supported by data.
3. Working draft of MS; very WIP!
4. Data are now provided as SQL dump files and csv files. Additionally an .Rmd file  is provided sketching out how to read the SQL dumps to generate the csvs.
